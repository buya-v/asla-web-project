ASLA: Autonomous Self-Learning Agents
The project is the landing page of the "ASLA Project." This page serves as the primary entry point for users, aiming to communicate the project's value proposition, showcase key features, and drive user registration/contact.
About ASLA
ASLA is a cutting-edge visual simulation of a fully autonomous AI software engineering agency. It demonstrates the future of "Agentic Workflows," where specialized AI models don't just answer prompts but collaborate in a structured, self-improving pipeline to build, deploy, and refine complex software projects.
🚀 The Core Vision
ASLA moves beyond simple chat interfaces into a coordinated multi-agent system. By simulating a complete software development lifecycle (SDLC), the platform showcases how autonomous agents can handle everything from high-level product strategy to low-level bug fixing and infrastructure management.
🧠 Technical Architecture
1. Multi-Agent Orchestration
The system utilizes a specialized fleet of agents, each with a distinct role and "system prompt" optimized for their domain:
Product Agent: Transforms vague visions into structured technical requirements and user stories using gemini-3-pro-preview.
Orchestrator: The brain of the operation, breaking down requirements into actionable tasks.
Execution Unit: The primary builder, responsible for code synthesis and unit testing.
DevOps Agent: Manages virtual deployments and infrastructure scaffolding.
Monitoring & Bug/QA: Operates the "observability" layer, identifying regressions and gathering performance metrics.
Learning Agent: The system's "Chief Optimizer" that analyzes recent failures and updates the entire agency's instruction set.
2. The Self-Learning Loop
ASLA's most unique feature is its Autonomous Feedback Loop. After each development cycle:
Metric Gathering: The Monitoring agent collects "efficiency" and "bug" data.
Performance Analysis: The Learning Agent reviews system logs and client feedback.
Prompt Optimization: Using gemini-3-flash-preview, the system identifies "Lessons Learned" and injects them into the global knowledge base, improving the efficiency of the next iteration.
3. Integrated Virtual File System
The simulation includes a real Isomorphic-Git implementation backed by LightningFS. Every "build" generated by the agents is a real set of commits in a virtualized IndexedDB repository, allowing for:
Real Git history visualization.
Codebase export as ZIP archives.
Cloning of existing public repositories for autonomous refactoring.
🛠 Tech Stack
Intelligence: Google Gemini API (gemini-3-pro-preview & gemini-3-flash-preview).
Frontend: React 19, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for physics-based agent animations).
Visuals: Lucide Icons & Recharts for real-time telemetry.
Storage: Isomorphic-Git + LightningFS (IndexedDB persistence).
📊 How to Use
Initialize: Define a "Vision" (e.g., "A decentralized cat social network").
Observe: Watch the Event Bus stream messages between agents.
Review: Use the Client Portal to test the generated prototype in a sandboxed staging environment.
Feedback: Provide thumbs up/down feedback. Watch the Learning Agent instantly update the system's strategy to address your concerns in the next cycle.
ASLA is designed to explore the boundaries of autonomous software synthesis and the practical application of self-improving AI workflows.

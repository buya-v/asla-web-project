## Iteration 2

## Insights & Optimizations

### 1. The occurrence of a blank screen indicates a critical lack of global error boundaries and fallback UI patterns, highlighting a need for more resilient state management and "fail-safe" rendering logic to handle unhandled exceptions or null data states.

### 2. The emergence of "undefined" feedback during iterative reviews exposes a critical lack of state-transition traceability, necessitating architectural enforcement of mandatory metadata capture to ensure the integrity of the decision-making audit trail.

## Iteration 3

## Insights & Optimizations

### 1. The occurrence of a blank screen indicates a critical lack of global error boundaries and fallback UI patterns, highlighting a need for more resilient state management and "fail-safe" rendering logic to handle unhandled exceptions or null data states.

### 2. The emergence of "undefined" feedback during iterative reviews exposes a critical lack of state-transition traceability, necessitating architectural enforcement of mandatory metadata capture to ensure the integrity of the decision-making audit trail.

### 3. The rejection suggests a disconnect between the front-end presentation and the underlying service layer, highlighting a need for a "walking skeleton" approach that prioritizes end-to-end functional integration over cosmetic completeness.

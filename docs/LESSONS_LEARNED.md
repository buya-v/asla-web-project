## Iteration 7

## Insights & Optimizations

### 1. The occurrence of a blank screen indicates a critical lack of global error boundaries and fallback UI patterns, highlighting a need for more resilient state management and "fail-safe" rendering logic to handle unhandled exceptions or null data states.

### 2. The emergence of "undefined" feedback during iterative reviews exposes a critical lack of state-transition traceability, necessitating architectural enforcement of mandatory metadata capture to ensure the integrity of the decision-making audit trail.

### 3. The rejection suggests a disconnect between the front-end presentation and the underlying service layer, highlighting a need for a "walking skeleton" approach that prioritizes end-to-end functional integration over cosmetic completeness.

### 4. The recurrence of "undefined" feedback during iterative reviews exposes a critical failure in the communication schema, demonstrating that an architecture is only as resilient as its ability to capture, validate, and persist meaningful stakeholder intent.

### 5. The occurrence of "undefined" feedback during iterative reviews signals a critical breakdown in the traceability between system requirements and validation outputs, necessitating an architectural framework that enforces structured, schema-based feedback loops to ensure all stakeholder inputs are actionable and state-driven.

### 6. The presence of "undefined" feedback highlights a failure in the architectural observability of the stakeholder feedback loop, necessitating a more robust data-capture mechanism to ensure that iterative cycles are driven by actionable telemetry rather than information vacuums.

### 7. The presence of undefined feedback during iterative reviews highlights a critical failure in the architectural feedback loop, necessitating more robust observability and standardized evaluation metrics to bridge the gap between technical execution and stakeholder expectations.
